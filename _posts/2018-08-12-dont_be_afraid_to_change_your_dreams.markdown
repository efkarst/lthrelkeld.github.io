In second grade I proclaimed my dream to be a math teacher when I grew up, rather than a ballerina or a fireman like my friends. Everyone laughed but I stuck to my dream, always asking for extra math homework because I loved being in what I called “the math zone” (what I later came to know as “flow”). I continued to embrace my love of math through grade school. I constantly found myself in “the math zone”: I spent hours doing every problem in the book, applied what I learned to the world around me, and ensured my understanding of how any why the math worked was flawless. Thought I loved just doing math, applying it became more important to me as I grew older. This desire landed me at Olin College where I self-designed a major in Mathematical Biology, hoping to use math to cure cancer.
 
Unfortunately, after pursuing applied math research for several years I was disappointed. Despite continuing to lose myself in “the math zone” (which now included building MatLab models), I wasn’t satisfied with the impact I had. I was building models to predict how cancer spreads through the body, but my work was largely theoretical and only loosely applicable to actual medicine. 
 
Towards the end of my college career I got to know a group of Computer Science students, and one of them asked why I had never tried Computer Science. This question caught me totally off guard - I was dumbfounded to realize that I had never even thought about doing anything but math. I had been blindly chasing my childhood dream for nearly 20 years without a second thought as to whether it was really the best fit for me.

For the next few weeks their question gnawed at the back of my mind. Why hadn't I tried this more impactful version of logical problem solving? One day I caved and cracked an online coding tutorial. Before I knew it I had been coding for nearly 6 hours and felt elated. I was totally in flow - just like when I did math problems. I immediately saw how powerful and meaningful coding could be for me. It would enable me to live and breathe the logical thinking I loved, while having a direct and meaningful impact on the people who use what I build. 

Unfortunately, when I had this epiphany I didn’t have the time or funding to build a coding skillset, so I got quickly scrounged up a job as a Product Manager at a tech company. I knew I’d have the direct impact I yearned for and could teach myself to code on the side. 

The Product Management role came fairly naturally to me, and for several years I debated whether I should begin my coding career at all. This internal debate ended promptly after I convinced myself to start another online bootcamp prep course. I was immediately lost in the code for hours, and realized that I hadn't been in the "flow" since I became a Product Manager! I loved optimizing every line of code to develop the most efficient and creative solutions; I loved the satisfaction of completing each incremental step and fixing each broken test. Everything about coding felt right. It brought me the same sweet feeling I had pouring through my math books as a child - joy.

Today I'm fully committed to my journey to learn to code. Some words of wisdom from an amateur web development student: Don't be afraid NOT to chase your dreams. In fact, open your eyes! Explore! You never know what dreams you'll stumble upon next.
